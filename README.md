## Connecting LEDs on Breadboard üçûüí°

To connect LEDs on a breadboard, follow these steps:

1. Insert the LEDs into the breadboard, ensuring the longer lead (positive) is on one side and the shorter lead (negative) is on the other side.
2. Connect the positive (longer) lead of each LED to a digital pin on the ESP8266 board (D2, D3, D6, D10).
3. Connect the negative (shorter) lead of each LED to the ground (GND) on the ESP8266 board.

4. Add widgets to the project dashboard to control the LEDs and monitor connectivity.

## Variable Setup

1. Create virtual pins in your Blynk project to communicate with the ESP8266.
2. Assign each LED and connectivity indicator to a specific virtual pin.

## Arduino Code Configuration

1. Open the Arduino code file [`LED_Button_Interfacing.ino`](code/LED_Button_Interfacing/LED_Button_Interfacing.ino) from this repository.
2. Include the Blynk library and configure the Wi-Fi credentials.
3. Initialize Blynk with your authentication token and connect to the Blynk server.
4. Map the virtual pins to the corresponding LEDs and connectivity indicators.
5. Implement functions to handle LED control and monitor connectivity status.

## Mobile App Configuration

1. Download and install the Blynk app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blynk-control-arduino-raspberry/id808760481) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.blynk).
2. Log in to the Blynk app using your account credentials.
3. Open the project created earlier in the web interface.
4. Configure the app interface by adding buttons, sliders, or other widgets to control the LEDs.
5. Create widgets to display the connectivity status of the ESP8266.

## Template Setup

1. Create templates on the Blynk web interface for the project dashboard.
2. Customize the templates with the desired layout and functionality.
3. Save the templates and ensure they are synchronized with the mobile app.

## Running the Project

1. Connect your mobile device to the same Wi-Fi network as the ESP8266.
2. Open the Blynk app and navigate to the project dashboard.
3. Use the widgets to control the LEDs and monitor connectivity.
4. Test different scenarios and functionalities to ensure proper operation.
