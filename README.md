# ESP8266-LED-Interfacing-with-Bluetooth-via-Blynk-App
This project demonstrates interfacing LEDs with a push button using an ESP8266 (D1 R1) and controlling them through Bluetooth using the Blynk app. The LEDs are connected to pins D2, D3, D6, and D10, while pin D1 is used to indicate connectivity with the cloud and network. A total of 5 LEDs are used in this project.
